# AI YouTube VTuber

This project is a YouTube VTuber (Virtual YouTuber) powered by AI. It utilizes various AI technologies to interact with users and provide spoken responses.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (install using `pip`):
  - [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
  - [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html)
  - [gtts](https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/)
  - [pyttsx3](https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/)
  - [playsound](https://pypi.org/project/playsound/)
  - [pydub](https://pypi.org/project/pydub/)

### Running the VTuber

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

3. Run the `main.py` script using the following command:

   ```shell
   python main.py
   ```

   This script will continuously read YouTube chat and respond using various AI voices.

## Code Structure

- `main.py`: The main script that reads YouTube chat and interacts with users.
- `llm.py`: Contains functions for interacting with an AI model hosted on rika-web.meetsonawane.repl.co.
- `tts.py`: Contains functions for text-to-speech (TTS) using different TTS engines.
- `chat.py`: Reusable functions for interacting with the Eleven Labs API and Google TTS.

## Usage

You can modify the behavior of the VTuber by editing the functions in `main.py` and using different TTS engines provided in `tts.py`. Customize the responses and AI interactions according to your requirements.
